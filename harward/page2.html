                    Our Partners in Education Foundation enables local organizations to 
                    connect with schools or programs within Harward  Schools. The purpose is 
                    to enrich and expand the educational opportunities of Harward students 
                    while promoting a deeper understanding of the school system within 
                    the community.
 
                    By establishing personal relationships between community leaders and 
                    educators, our goal is to create a spirit of involvement that has a 
                    positive impact on Harward. This involvement helps local schools 
                    become places where community members work with students and help 
                    prepare them to succeed in an ever-changing world.
